## Applications of number theory
This was an undergraduate level project for the number theory course I had chosen. It discusses the mathematical and implementation details of various applications of number theoretical concepts and ideas in the real world, especially in technology. I have also made basic demonstrative implementations in Python (Jupyter Notebook format), available in the repository. The applications considered were:

- Pseudorandom number generation
- Error checking of messages in networks (including the use of Hamming code)
- Hash functions
- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm and the mathematics behind its working
- Barcode scanning
- Cryptography
